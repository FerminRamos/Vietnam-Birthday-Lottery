# Vietnam-Birthday-Lottery
A lottery based on birth dates was conducted by the U.S. Selective Service System on December 1, 1969, to determine the draft order of the Vietnam War  for men born between January 1, 1944, and December 31, 1950. This repository analyses the likelihood of someone being selected based on their birthday.
